	<h1> HTML ERROR CODE  404  - File Not Found </h1>	 
	
	<P>
		The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI.
		 No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. The 410 (Gone)
		  status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some internally 
		  configurable mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no 
		  forwarding address. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish 
		  to reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other response is applicable.
